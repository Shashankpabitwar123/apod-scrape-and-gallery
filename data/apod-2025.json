    "explanation": "Explanation:  \n\nEclipses tend to come in pairs.\n\nTwice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts\nabout 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align.\n\nThen the full and new\nphases of the Moon,\nseparated by just over 14 days, create a lunar and a solar eclipse.\n\nBut only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon\nphases during a single eclipse season close enough\nto produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular)\nlunar and solar eclipses.\n\nMore often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season.\n\nIn fact, the last eclipse season of 2024 produced\nthis fortnight-separated eclipse pair:\n\na partial lunar eclipse on 18 September\nand\nan annular solar eclipse\non 2 October.\n\nThe time-lapse composite images were captured from\nSomerset, UK (left) and\nRapa Nui planet Earth.\n\nThe\n2025 eclipse seasons\nwill see a total lunar eclipse on 14 March\npaired with a partial solar eclipse on 29 March,\nand a total lunar eclipse on 8 September\nfollowed by a partial solar eclipse on 21 September.",
