    "explanation": "Explanation:  \nTen thousand years ago, before the dawn of recorded human history, \na new light would suddenly have appeared in the \nnight sky and faded after a few weeks.  \n\nToday we know this light was from a\nsupernova,\nor exploding star,\nand record the expanding debris cloud as the \nVeil Nebula, a \nsupernova remnant.  \n\nThis sharp telescopic view is centered on a\nwestern\nsegment of the \nVeil Nebula cataloged as \nNGC 6960 but less formally known as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  \n\nBlasted out in the cataclysmic explosion, an \ninterstellar shock wave plows\nthrough space sweeping up and exciting interstellar material.\n\nImaged with narrow band filters, the \nglowing filaments are\nlike long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on,\nremarkably well separated into atomic hydrogen (red)\nand oxygen (blue-green) gas.\n\nThe complete supernova remnant lies about 1400\nlight-years \naway towards the\nconstellation Cygnus.\n\nThis Witch's Broom actually spans about 35 light-years.\n\nThe bright star in the frame is \n52 Cygni,\nvisible with the unaided eye from \na dark location but unrelated to the ancient supernova remnant.",
